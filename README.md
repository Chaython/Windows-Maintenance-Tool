## üß™ Troubleshooting & FAQ

**Q: The script didn‚Äôt restart as Admin?**  
A: Make sure UAC is enabled. Right-click and select **Run as Administrator**.

**Q: Why does it crash when selecting registry cleanup?**  
A: This has been fixed in v3.1.0. The script now safely lists and deletes registry keys using PowerShell, and errors are properly handled.

**Q: Why was Registry Defrag removed?**  
A: The feature depended on a third-party tool (NTREGOPT) which is no longer accessible.  
The script is now fully offline and native to Windows.
